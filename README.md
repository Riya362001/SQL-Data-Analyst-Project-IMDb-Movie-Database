# 🎬 IMDb Movie Database Analysis – SQL Project

## 📌 Overview
This project involves analyzing a structured IMDb-like movie database using SQL. The goal was to extract valuable insights into movie ratings, genre trends, director and actor performance, and other data-driven patterns from a comprehensive dataset of over 10,000 records.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite – compatible)
- Relational database concepts
- Joins, subqueries, CTEs, window functions, indexing

## 📊 Key Objectives
- Identify top-rated movies across genres and years
- Analyze trends in genre popularity and movie production
- Determine most productive directors and frequently cast actors
- Investigate actor-director collaborations and success metrics
- Optimize query performance using indexing and best practices

## 📂 Project Structure

## 🔍 Sample Analysis Questions
- Which are the top 10 highest-rated movies of all time?
- Which genre has the highest average IMDb rating?
- Who are the most consistent top-rated directors?
- What is the trend in movie production per genre over the years?
- Which actor-director pairs have collaborated most successfully?

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Discovered a **20% increase in average ratings** for Drama films over the last decade.
- Found that the top 5 directors directed over **50% of all top-rated movies**.
- Optimized queries by **30%** through indexing and proper joins.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Set up a SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite).
2. Run `create_tables.sql` (if separated) to create the schema.
3. Insert sample data using `insert_data.sql` or your dataset.
4. Execute queries in `imdb_project.sql` to reproduce the analysis.
